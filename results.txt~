The first thing I found was that the mutation rates were way to low. By doubling all of them, I was able to get to the final outcome over a hundred generations sooner. I tried modifying my distance equation to check for distances between letters, but as it turns out, no matter how I weighed it, I ended up encouraging the program to delete letters and then add them back in rather than substituting existing letters, which took much longer and was not nearly as interesting to watch.
