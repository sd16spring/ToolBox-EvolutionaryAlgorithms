This toolbox has provided me with a basic understanding of what are and how to use genetic algorithms. Even though the cost function contains the target string, we can still learn how cost functions work.

In terms of the mutation, given a small number of generations, it is very difficult to evolve past a certain number of letters. For example, let's look at at 26 character string, the alphabet, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ". If we run for 500 generations, we can only get a levenshtein distance of 2-5. If we run 1000 generations, we can get a levenshtein distance of 1-2.  If we run 1500 generations, we almost always a levenshtein distance of 0, a the exact copy of the targe string.
