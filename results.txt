The first time I ran the evolutionary algorithm, I was not getting a result
with "HELLO WORLD" as the input text in 500 generations. The levenshtein distance
never went below 2.

However, when I switched to a mu plus lambda simulation and set mu (the number that
suurvive) to 100 and lambda (the number of offspring) to 200, I reached the goal
message in 176 generations. This is significantly marked improvement.
