I played around with the population size.  Interestingly enough, the algorithm achieved the goal within approximately the same number of generations at pop=150 as it did at pop=300, failed to achieve the goal with pop=200, and achieved the goal much more quickly with pop=250.

There didn't seem to be a whole lot of correlation between the initial population size and the number of generations required to achieve the goal, though if I ran the program enough times, I might see a correlation.
