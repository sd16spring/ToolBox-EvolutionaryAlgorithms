When increasing the probably of mutation, the program had an easier time reaching a lower distance 
from the end goal. However, higher probabilities of mutation also increased the probability of 
the program getting stuck at a distance of 1 since only one trait needed to change and changing 
more than one trait resulted in a further distance. In general, increasing the probability of
deletions and substitution did not help the program to reach the end goal but increasing the
probability of insertion tended to increase efficiency. Overall, there is a balance, but certain
mutations tend to have a larger impact than others.

Increasing the probability of mating tends to slow down the program's process of achieving the
end goal while decreasing it appears to increase the success rate of the program until it reaches
a low distance.
