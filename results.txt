After running the program several times with the default string and not achieving the target message within the 500 generations, I decided to increase all rates of mutations, population size, and number of generations run.  Increasing the population size caused the program to reach the target within fewer generations, as there was a larger pool of messages from which to select from and thus a greater chance that a message close to the target will be created with each generation.  Increasing the rate of mutations was useful until a certain rate was reached, but higher rates of mutations cause the differences between generations to be too sporadic and random, and generations' offspring are less weighted towards developing to the target message.  Increasing the number of generations simply increased the number of trials run, offering more time for the target message to be reached when increased, and limiting the time when decreased.
